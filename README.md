# Edabit-Challenges-Javascript

Going through Edabit challenges, making notes to learn and teach more effectively in Javascript. 

(Even obvious notes are put in [for me] to make sure that I am able to better communicate concisely to others [if I am teaching] what is happening and in a way that is accessible and relateable.)

Thanks for reading!

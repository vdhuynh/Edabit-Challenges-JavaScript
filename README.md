# Edabit-Challenges-Javascript

I'm learning through Edabit challenges, making notes to be able to learn and teach more effectively in Javascript. 

Even obvious notes are put in to make sure that I am able to understand clearly and communicate concisely to others what is happening.

Thanks for reading!

//A student learning JavaScript was trying to make a function. 
//His code should concatenate a passed string name with string "Edabit" and store it in a variable called result. 
//He needs your help to fix this code.

function nameString(name){
	result = name + "Edabit"; //variable assignment: result stores name + "Edabit"
	return result; //storing the variable for later use if function is called
}

//Create a function that takes an array containing only numbers and return the first element.

function getFirstValue(arr) {
	return arr[0];
}

//arr is a list (a collection of items)
/*to access an element (the item in the list, e,g (numbers 1-4) = [1, 2, 3, 4]), use brackets with the name of the list 
in front of the brackets: arr[0]*/
//lists starts at index 0, not 1
//index is the place of the element

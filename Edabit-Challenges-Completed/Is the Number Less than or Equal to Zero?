//Create a function that takes a number as its only argument and returns true if it's less than or equal to zero, otherwise return false.

function lessThanOrEqualToZero(num) {
	return num <= 0 ? true: false //conditional (ternary operator)
}

//the ternary operator allows for shorter code, not having to write if(num <= ) {true} else . . . and can be done in one line. 
// the ? is the conditional (think that it's asking the question: is num <= 0 ?)
//If the condition is true, the first statement after ? follows (true); if the condition is not true, then after the colon (:) false
//Multiple ternary operators can be chained together

/* In this challenge, you must verify the equality of two different values given the parameters a and b.

Both the value and type of the parameters need to be equal. The possible types of the given parameters are:

Numbers
Strings
Booleans (false or true)
Special values: undefined, null and NaN
What have you learned so far that will permit you to do two different checks (value and type) with a single statement?

Implement a function that returns true if the parameters are equal, and false if they are not.

*/

function checkEquality(a, b) {
  return a === b; 
}

/*The strict equality operator (===) behaves 
identically to the abstract equality operator (==) 
except no type conversion is done, 
and the types must be the same to be considered equal.*/

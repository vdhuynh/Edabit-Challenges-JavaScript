/*Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.*/

function addition(a, b) { // a, b are parameters that can stand for any number (argument) we want to put in later when we call the function.
	return a + b;
}

//parameters = a, b
//argument = addition(5, 4); 5 and 4 are arguments, a and b are parameters
